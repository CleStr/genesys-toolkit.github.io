  <h2>🥬 About the gEneSys Project</h2>
  <h3>Transforming Gendered Interrelations of Power and Inequalities in Transition Pathways to Sustainable Energy Systems</h3>
  <p>The gEneSys Project explores how gender and power shape the global transition to sustainable energy. While the European Union’s Just Transition Mechanism calls for a transition that is fair and inclusive, gEneSys asks what that truly means in practice — for women and men, for communities, and for the institutions driving change.</p>
  <p>Our goal is to make the energy transition more equitable by understanding and addressing the gendered dimensions of power, participation, and opportunity across the social, economic, technological, environmental, and governance domains of energy systems.</p>
  <p>Through a mix of research, data analysis, policy dialogue, and educational tools, gEneSys aims to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Build a solid evidence base on how gendered power relations influence energy systems and transitions.</li>
    <li>Identify and reduce inequalities, especially those that limit women’s participation and leadership in the energy sector.</li>
    <li>Integrate gender perspectives into the implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</li>
    <li>Demonstrate how applying a gender lens to energy knowledge and innovation can lead to fairer, more effective, and socially accepted transition pathways.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>By connecting researchers, policymakers, educators, and citizens, gEneSys supports a transformation that is not only carbon-neutral, but also just and inclusive for all.</p>
