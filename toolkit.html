      <h3>In a nutshell: Why the energy transition is not gender-neutral</h3>
      <blockquote style="text-align: center;">
        <i><b>"Everything starts from energy, yet everyday energy drudgery of women in rural and urban settings is something that often goes unnoticed. The whole day is around the energy compass: A woman’s entire day is governed by energy, and without access to energy, then really nothing is going right for that woman or her household, from her own health and well-being to the opportunities that she could offer to her children, to the ability to earn a better income."</b></i><br><br>
        – Nitisha Agrawal, founder of the Smokeless Cookstove Foundation initiative and mentor for the Women in Clean Cooking Mentorship Programme.<br>

      <blockquote style="text-align: center;">
        <i><b>"It’s up to us as stewards to usher in the next generation and provide our support. We need to help create space and change perceptions, where often young women don’t believe they are technically capable or competent enough to take leadership roles in renewable energy. As women, we must take calculated risks, we must step out of the well-trodden path and create spaces for ourselves and the next generation to lead,” Prescod added."</b></i><br><br>
