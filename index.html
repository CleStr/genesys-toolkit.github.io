  <h2>Discover the Toolkit</h2>
  <p>Why does this matter? The gEneSys Project fights unequal power in the shift to sustainable energy. EU experts say carbon-neutral goals must be fair for everyone—women, men, and communities alike. This toolkit helps make that real by boosting women's roles in energy decisions, creating projects that serve diverse groups, and sparking lasting innovations.</p>

  <p>This easy-to-use toolkit helps trainers, funders, and researchers make energy projects fairer for everyone. It shares simple   steps and real examples on how to include women's voices and needs in clean energy work—like solar power or policy planning—so transitions benefit all communities, not just some.</p>
  <p>This Toolkit contributes to the EU ambitions by advancing women’s participation in energy transitions, and fostering inclusive innovation.
  <p>This tool kit:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Assembles evidence from EU and global case studies on how gender equality drives sustainable energy outcomes.</li>
  <li>Start by picking your role (e.g., researcher,funder or leader) to get tailored tips and resources that fit your daily work.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  
  <h3>Behind the gEneSys Project</h3>
  <p>The gEneSys Project works to fix unequal power dynamics in moving to sustainable energy. Experts from the EU advise that going carbon-neutral should be fair and just for all.</p>
  <p>This Toolkit supports those goals by focusing on real change: more women in energy decisions, better projects for diverse groups, and innovative ideas that last.</p>
