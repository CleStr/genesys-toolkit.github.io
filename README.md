## What is this toolkit?

The **gEneSys Gender & Energy Toolkit** is an interactive, research-informed digital resource designed to support the integration of gender equality and social inclusion into energy-sector policies, programmes and research.

It provides **tailored recommendations and practical resources** for three key stakeholder groups in the energy–gender nexus:
